To use the website, you need to first launch XAMPP on your computer and import the Library database into your localhost. 

Once that is done, you will need to import your files into your htdocs folder in your XAMPP directory. 

You will then need to go into your browser and type localhost/login_page.php to run the website.

There will be a video in the zip file that we uploaded on moodle showcasing how the website works as well as a report documenting the SQL queries and database implementations.
